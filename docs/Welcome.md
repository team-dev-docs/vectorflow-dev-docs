VectorFlow is an open source, high throughput, fault tolerant vector embedding pipeline. With a simple API request, you can send raw data that will be embedded and stored in any vector database or returned back to you.

This current version is an MVP and should not be used in production yet. Right now the system only supports uploading single TXT or PODF files at a time, up to 25 MB.
