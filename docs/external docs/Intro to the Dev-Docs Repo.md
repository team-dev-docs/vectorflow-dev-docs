## Dev-Docs Repo File Structure

In the repo there are a lot of configuration files you can customize and extend, but with Dev-Docs you will not likely need to modify them. Instead you should focus on three main places to add your docs which are the <code>docs</code>, <code>blog</code>, and <code>pages</code> folder.  Check out the[ pages](#Src/pages).

## Docs Folder

This is where you be writing the bulk of your documentation. You just need to add a markdown to start creating content.

## Blog

Any markdown files placed here will automatically become blog posts.

## Src/pages

At the moment the only page you have to worry about here is <code>_landing_page.md</code>. This is the landing page for your docs, so don't be afraid to make it awesome!!!
